##  Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v9.0.0 or higher) - Comes with Node.js
- **MongoDB** - Either:
  - [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local installation)
  - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) (cloud-based, free tier available)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fazetanish/Mentor-Mentee.git
cd Mentor-Mentee
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (you can copy from `env.example` in the root):
   ```bash
   cp ../env.example .env
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Open the `.env` file and fill in your values:
   ```env
   # MongoDB Connection
   Mongo_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mentor-mentee
   # Or for MongoDB Atlas:
   # Mongo_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mentor-mentee

   # JWT Secret (use a strong, random string)
   JWT_Secret_User=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

   # Email Configuration (Gmail)
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
   ```

   **📝 Setting up Gmail App Password:**
   1. Go to your [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
   3. Go to "App passwords" (search in settings)
   4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   5. Use this 16-character password as `EMAIL_PASS`

5. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   
   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`
   
   You should see:
   ```
   Server running on port 3000
   Email configured for: your-email@gmail.com
   Email server is ready to send messages
   ```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

1. **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 4: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173/Mentor-Mentee
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
